# Back End REST APIs Using Rails

This git repository is for Section 12 of the Ruby on Rails Back End Class.  You should follow the instructions for
that class section.  After you clone and fork this workspace, create a new git branch called rest.  The work
you do to create the API should be in this branch.  When that work is complete, push your rest branch to github.
Then create a pull request as usual.
Then create a new git branch called swagger from the rest branch.  The work you do to enable your API application for Swagger should
be in this branch.  When that work is complete, push your swagger branch to github, and create another pull request for that branch.
